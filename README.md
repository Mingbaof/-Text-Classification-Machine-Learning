Machine Learning Approaches for Text Classification: A Study on Spam Detection

Introduction:
Welcome to the "Machine Learning Approaches for Text Classification: A Study on Spam Detection" project! In this venture, we aim to address the challenge of categorizing text into 'spam' or 'ham (not spam)' using various machine learning algorithms. Our focus is on establishing a robust training-validation-test framework and employing a systematic approach to hyperparameter tuning. The significance of spam detectors in our daily interactions with text messaging cannot be overstated, making the deployment of effective classifiers crucial. Leveraging the power of machine learning, this project explores the training and fine-tuning of diverse models tailored specifically for spam detection.
